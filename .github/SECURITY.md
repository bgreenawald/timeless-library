### Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

- **Automated Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot monitors for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Scanning**: CodeQL analyzes code for security vulnerabilities
- **Security Audits**: Regular npm audit checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Secure Defaults**: Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit secrets, tokens, or passwords to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all external inputs
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Sanitize user inputs when displaying them
