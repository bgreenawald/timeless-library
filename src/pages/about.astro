        <p class="mt-6 text-lg md:text-xl max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          {SITE_CONFIG.name} is a project dedicated to bringing classic literature to contemporary readers.
          We utilize advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to modernize the language and context of timeless stories,
          making them accessible and engaging for a new generation, while meticulously preserving the original's essence and artistic integrity.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          Our process emphasizes transparency, providing detailed insights into the LLM prompts and metadata used for each modernization.
          We also support multiple versions of each book, allowing readers to explore different interpretations and evolutions of the modernized texts.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg md:text-xl max-w-2xl mx-auto">
          All content on this site is dynamically generated from a source GitHub repository at build time,
          ensuring that our collection is always up-to-date and reflective of the latest modernizations.
          We believe in the power of technology to bridge the gap between classic literature and modern audiences,
          fostering a deeper appreciation for the enduring narratives that have shaped our world.
