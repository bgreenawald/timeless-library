description:
  "Published after Tocqueville’s nine-month tour of the United States, Volume I
  provides a detailed examination of the American political system, including
  the Constitution, the role of local government (townships), and the judicial
  branch. He explores the 'equality of conditions' as the defining
  characteristic of American life and introduces the influential concept of the
  'tyranny of the majority.' The volume famously concludes with his predictions
  regarding the future of the American Union and the rise of the United States
  and Russia as competing global powers."
