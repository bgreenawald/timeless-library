description:
  "Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future is a book by
  philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886. In it, Nietzsche
  attacks past philosophers for their lack of critical sense and their blind
  acceptance of Christian dogmas. He moves 'beyond good and evil' in the sense
  of leaving behind the traditional morality which he believes to be a product
  of historical forces and psychological needs."
