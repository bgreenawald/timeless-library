description:
  'The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature is a book by
  psychologist and philosopher William James. It comprises his edited Gifford
  Lectures on natural theology, which were delivered at the University of
  Edinburgh, Scotland, between 1901 and 1902. The lectures concerned the nature
  of religion and the neglect of science in the academic study of religion. Soon
  after its publication, Varieties entered the Western canon of psychology and
  philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.'
