  "A transformative philosophical work that argues God is an outward projection
  of humanity's own inner nature. Feuerbach famously asserts that 'the secret of
  theology is anthropology'."
description:
  'A foundational text in the development of modern atheism and humanism.
  Feuerbach critiques traditional Christian dogma by suggesting that religious
  deities are idealized reflections of human virtues and needs. By reclaiming
  these projected attributes, he argues that humanity can achieve true
  self-realization. This work was a massive influence on the Young Hegelians,
  particularly Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.'
