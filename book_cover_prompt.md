# Book Cover Generation Prompt for Timeless Library

## Design Requirements

Create a minimalist book cover with the following structure:

### Layout Structure
The entire image should be the book cover, divided into three solid color blocks:

1. **Main Title Block** (top 60% of cover)
   - Fills the top 60% of the entire image
   - Single solid color
   - Book title in a clean, modern sans-serif font
   - Centered text with generous padding
   - Font weight: Medium to Semi-bold
   - Text color: High contrast against the block color (white on dark, dark on light)

2. **Author Bar** (middle 25% of cover)
   - Fills the middle 25% of the entire image
   - Different solid color from the title block
   - Author name(s) in the same modern font family
   - Centered text
   - Font weight: Regular to Medium
   - Text color: High contrast against the bar color

3. **Edition Block** (bottom 15% of cover)
   - Fills the bottom 15% of the entire image
   - Same color as the title block
   - Text: "modernized edition" in lowercase
   - Same modern font family
   - Centered text
   - Font weight: Light to Regular
   - Text color: High contrast against the block color

### Color Palette Guidelines
Base the color scheme on these warm, elegant tones from the Timeless Library theme:

**Primary Palette:**
- Warm cream/off-white: `rgb(250, 243, 232)` - #FAF3E8
- Soft dark gray: `rgb(58, 58, 58)` - #3A3A3A
- Muted gold: `rgb(180, 140, 79)` - #B48C4F
- Darker gold: `rgb(156, 120, 66)` - #9C7842
- Subtle border gray: `rgb(229, 224, 215)` - #E5E0D7

**Color Combination Rules:**
- Use 2-3 colors maximum per cover
- Ensure high contrast between text and background (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- The title and edition blocks should use the same color
- The author bar should use a contrasting color
- Avoid pure black or pure white - use the theme's softer tones
- Consider using complementary or analogous color schemes

### Typography
- **Font Family:** Modern sans-serif (similar to Poppins)
- **Font Sizes:** 
  - Title: Large, prominent (scale appropriately for title length)
  - Author: Medium size
  - Edition: Smaller, subtle
- **Letter Spacing:** Slightly tight (-0.025em for titles)
- **Line Height:** Generous spacing for readability

### Technical Specifications
- **Aspect Ratio:** 2:3 (standard book cover ratio)
- **Resolution:** High resolution (at least 1200x1800px)
- **Format:** Clean vector-style design
- **Cover Composition:** The entire image is the book cover, completely filled by the three color blocks
- **Content:** Only solid color blocks and typography - no imagery, borders, or decorative elements
- **No gradients or textures**

### Style Variations
For different books, consider these color combinations:
1. **Classic:** Cream background, dark gray title/edition, gold author bar
2. **Elegant:** Dark gray background, cream title/edition, gold author bar
3. **Warm:** Gold background, dark gray title/edition, cream author bar
4. **Sophisticated:** Dark gray background, gold title/edition, cream author bar
5. **Minimal:** Cream background, dark gray title/edition, light gray author bar

### Quality Requirements
- Clean, professional appearance
- Excellent readability at various sizes
- Consistent with the Timeless Library's elegant, literary aesthetic
- Modern yet timeless design
- No visual clutter or unnecessary elements
- Perfect alignment and spacing

The final cover should feel like it belongs in a sophisticated library while maintaining a contemporary, accessible design that appeals to modern readers.
